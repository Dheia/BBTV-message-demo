<small class="content_text  text-muted">SextPanther offers Chargeback Protection to all models free of charge. Chargeback Protection covers up to $2,500 USD

<small class="content_text text-muted">This coverage is limited to activity on the SextPanther platform, and is not applicable on services or payments facilitated outside of the badbunnies.com</small><br><br>
<small class="content_text text-muted">Tips sent through the Bad Bunnies platform that are part of disputed transactions are reviewed on a case-by-case basis and your earnings will be adjusted accordingly.</small><br><br>

<small class="content_text text-muted">Bad Bunnies reserves the right to refuse Chargeback Protection to any model who knowingly participates in fraudulent transactions. In the event a model is aware a customer is going to file a chargeback or has previously filed chargebacks against them on SextPanther or other adult websites, Chargeback Protection will not apply towards any transactions involving this customer. If the model continues to engage with this customer, by providing services, they do so at their own risk, and without Chargeback Protection.</small>
<small class="content_text text-muted">Bad Bunnies further reserves the right to refuse ongoing Chargeback Protection to any model with an excessive history of chargebacks and may become ineligible for this coverage. Models who become ineligible for Chargeback Protection will be notified of policy cancelation with at least 7 days notice.</small>
<small class="content_text text-muted">If you have any additional questions or concerns about Chargeback Protection, please email models@badbunnies.com.</small>
